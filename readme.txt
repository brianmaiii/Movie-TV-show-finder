3. Project Name: Project 8: OMDB GUI

4. Get ready to explore all your favorite shows with just a click of a button! We have brought to you a program which you can use that will give you all your favorite seasons and episodes from the shows that you love the most. All you have to do is choose first which program you want to use and then follow the instructions that are given! After this, you need to identify what show you want to see information on and then identify what seasons and episodes you are looking for. After, don’t forget to save your research by downloading the summaries that you have gathered for your reference in your very own computer! This is a program that never sleeps so feel free to keep playing with it as much as you want! 

5. Our code was able to bring two GUI’s that displayed information differently. While the model and the functionality of the code was the same for both views, the way that the user is able to see information displayed is different and based on what they would like their preference to be. Both user interface start off with a box asking the user to enter the show that they want to search. After this, it is when the information gets displayed differently. The user can either choose to go with a interface that allows them to just see the results of the seasons and episodes but the other interface allows the user to not only see the seasons and episodes but ALSO take notes on what they want to keep within the window. There is also an added scrollbar to this specific view but essentially both views equip the user to be able to see what episodes they want to add to their list. The programs don’t let the user add an episode more than once and it also ensures that they are adding episodes that only exist. Failure to do so results in them getting a message on the shell stating that they have entered incorrect user input and the the season or episodes doesn’t exist. After this, the first user interface allows the user to be able to just see the summaries of the episodes that the user has selected. The second gui actually allows the user to see the summary plus enable them to see the seasons, episodes and titles that they searched to cross reference whether they have the correct information on their screen. From here, both gui’s enable the user to be able to enter a specific folder that they want to save their files in and from here, they are able to save the information that they searched up onto their computer in the folder that they have indicated. 

6. Difficulty Rate: 8 - One of the things that we struggled with the most on this project were the different guis and being able to go from differentiating the code from one gui to the next without jeopardizing the model. Overall, we were able to complete it but we were pretty limited on what we could do. 

7. Third party libraries were tkinter, json, csv, pathlib, Path, os, urllib.parse, and urllib.request.
